# Money-Team

1. I would like for the class to be longer, so we would not have to rush to have the website to be finished.
2. Our project consists of tables and pictures of the participants in sports at our school.
3. Our client is our school, JCM-Early College High. We are showcasing the athletics at our school. Throughout this process, it has had its ups and downs. We have dealt with frustrations of our website not cooperating sometimes. It has been a challenge to get all of our pages responsive on all devices. I wish we had started earlier or had more time to perfect our website.

1. If there was one thing I could change about coding class, I would allow more time to work in treehouse before starting website.
2. Our website is a sports page for Early College High. It gives schedules, rosters, and updated information.
3. Our client is mainly the students and faculty of Early College. Making our page responsive was a very challenging task. Most of our pictures and tables overlapped when taking a mobile approach. Creating the page was very fun and was definitely a task I would repeat.
